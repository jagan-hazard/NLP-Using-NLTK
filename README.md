This repo contains some Basic things about Natural language processing using NLTK


What is Natural Language Processing(NLP):
-----------------------------------------
  Natural Language Processing is all about processing natural language data such as the text and speech signals. we can process these datas using various machine learning architecture. Then we can apply it into many useful application in real time like chatbot, language translation, text conversion and so on.

  There are various frameworks available for NLP, some of them are
  
      1)Tensorflow,
      2)Caffe,
      3)CNTK,
      4)NLTK and so on.
      
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK):
-----------------------------------
  NLTK is a library written in python particularly for the natural language processing. It's more easy to install and use if u have python already installed in your system.
  
   Installing NLTK package using PIP:
    ---------------------------------
    
    1) Install using pip package manager
    
          pip install nltk
          
    2) Check whether installation is done correctly or not:
     
          import nltk
       
    3) Install additional necessary package for  nltk:
    
          import nltk
          nltk.download()
          
        this command will show available packages, you just select all the packages and download it. It will take a while to download the packages. 
       
     If everything went fine, then you sucessfully installed nltk and their additional packages.
